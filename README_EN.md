# nnU-Net

In 3D biomedical image segmentation, dataset properties like imaging modality, image sizes, voxel spacings, class 
ratios etc vary drastically.

**nnU-Net is the first segmentation method that is designed to deal with the dataset diversity found in the domain. It 
condenses and automates the keys decisions for designing a successful segmentation pipeline for any given dataset.**

nnU-Net makes the following contributions to the field:

1. **Standardized baseline:** nnU-Net is the first standardized deep learning benchmark in biomedical segmentation.
Without manual effort, researchers can compare their algorithms against nnU-Net on an arbitrary number of datasets 
to provide meaningful evidence for proposed improvements. 
2. **Out-of-the-box segmentation method:** nnU-Net is the first plug-and-play tool for state-of-the-art biomedical 
segmentation. Inexperienced users can use nnU-Net out of the box for their custom 3D segmentation problem without 
need for manual intervention. 
3. **Framework:** nnU-Net is a framework for fast and effective development of segmentation methods. Due to its modular 
structure, new architectures and methods can easily be integrated into nnU-Net. Researchers can then benefit from its
generic nature to roll out and evaluate their modifications on an arbitrary number of datasets in a 
standardized environment.
